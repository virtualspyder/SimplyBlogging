          <p>In the month before the rally, cases had begun to fall. But four weeks after the event, the rate of new cases in the county skyrocketed by 225%, outpacing the 74% increase the rest of the state experienced in the same time period.
            CNN also looked at the September 18 rally in Bemidji, Minnesota and found that while rates of infection had already been increasing in the month prior to the rally, the rate of infection in the county one month later had jumped by more than 385% and was greater than the state's rate of infection.</p></li>

          <h2>Biden campaign blames Facebook for $500,000 in lost fundraising
          </h2>
          <p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign said Thursday it had lost out on more than $500,000 in potential campaign donations this week and blamed Facebook after issues with the social media's advertising systems had prevented the campaign from running some ads soliciting donations.

            Facebook (FB) acknowledged Thursday evening that "technical flaws" had prevented some campaigns from running some ads this week.
            "We find ourselves 5 days out from Election Day unable to trust that our ads will run properly, or if our opponents are being given an unfair, partisan advantage," Biden campaign's digital director Rob Flaherty said Thursday.
            Facebook said the technical issues impacted both presidential campaigns. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.</p></li>
